Staff Software Engineer,Gruntwork,Canada,2024-03-17,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3860722170/,"About Gruntwork:
Gruntwork is on a mission to transform the way DevOps is done. Let’s face it: designing, launching, and managing infrastructure is still a terrible experience for most organizations, but it doesn’t have to be that way!
We are globally recognized both for our open source tools used by thousands of companies from startups to Fortune 500s, and our extensive thought leadership content on how DevOps should be done. Now we’re looking for product-focused engineers who can help us build out our vision for the next-generation DevOps management platform.
About this role:
We're looking for a product-focused Staff Software Engineer to not only design and code complex features across our product suite, but also mentor other engineers and help shape our technical strategy. This will involve:
- Creating new and improving existing CLI tooling with Go
- Working extensively with AWS
- Scaling and building new features for our SaaS platform using Next.js/Node/Typescript/Tailwind
- Working with IaC modules written in Terraform/OpenTofu
- Working with other tech as needed including Python, K8s, and Bash
- Working with our open source tools Terragrunt, Terratest, Boilerplate, and others, all written in Go. 
- Guiding our team on key architecture decisions
- Leading the way on software engineering best practices
- Setting a positive example for your colleagues to follow
About the team:
Gruntwork today is one large engineering team, plus a product designer and product manager, both of whom have technical backgrounds.
In this role you’ll help us build out our product suite with a primary focus on Pipelines, Patcher, and a new product, and a secondary focus on Library. Over time, we plan to evolve to a handful of cross-functional squads, each focused entirely on one product.
About working together:
Gruntwork is 100% remote, however we organize a company-wide in-person meetup roughly every 4 months.
One of our values is that work-life balance leads to both better work and a better life, so we require that all our team members live in a time zone between Los Angeles and New York, inclusive. You can be located anywhere in the western hemisphere, though most of our team is in the USA and Canada.
We’re looking for a Grunt who:
- Has proven technical leadership experience. You have prior experience as a tech lead and played a key role in enabling a higher-performing engineering team, both in the technical guidance you provided and the cultural example you set. 
- Has shipped a lot of software. You’ve worked closely with product managers, designers, and other software engineers to create impactful products, and you know what it takes to ship high-quality software. 
- Knows software engineering principles. You're familiar with most of the following: OOP concepts, automated testing, complexity management, type systems, core data structures, concurrency, and functional programming concepts. 
- Has full stack experience. You know how to write code across the stack and have experience in the following (or similar languages): Go, Python, Typescript, Bash, React, Next.js. 
- Has DevOps experience. You have extensive experience working with at least one major cloud provider and at least a moderate amount of DevOps experience. 
- Loves to get things done. Your joy is shipping and refining features that customers love. You make good tradeoffs, prioritize thoughtfully, and work efficiently. You generally get a lot done for time worked. 
- Enjoys writing docs. You recognize that docs are an essential part of the product and the way that customers learn to use what you've built. You're excited to share your work with the customer. 
- Cares about code quality. You know that code is read 10x as much as it's written so you care about how your code looks and reads for your unknown future colleagues who will read what you write. 
- Cares about security. You constantly think about the security implications of what you're doing and take steps to make your code reasonably secure. 
- Cares about your fellow humans. You look to make personal connections with the people you work with, and you want to work for a company whose mission and people you believe in. 
What we offer:
- No investors, no debt. We control our own destiny and are focused on building a company that customers love. 
- Systematically above-market salary. We compute all salaries using a formula designed to systematically pay above market, wherever you live. 
- Meaningful equity. We offer a meaningful chunk of equity to all current and new team members. We’ve even put in place a “progressive equity” plan where if there is a large exit event, employees end up with a progressively larger portion of the proceeds than their pro-rata equity holdings. 
- Profit-sharing bonus. We set aside a pot of money at the end of each year based on profits and distribute bonuses according to a formula that uses as inputs your level within the company and the length of your tenure at the company. 
- Hardware budget. We'll buy you a brand new state-of-the-art 16"" Apple MacBook Pro (or other computer of your choosing of equivalent value) upon joining. It will be owned by you, not the company. 
- Personal Budget. We'll give you a personal budget of $1,000 USD per month (yes, per month) to spend on your workspace (e.g., a co-working space), health (e.g., gym, yoga), time (e.g., babysitter), and/or learning (e.g., books, courses). 
- Medical/Dental/Vision Insurance. We offer a range of high-quality plans with a large portion paid by the company. For countries other than the US, this includes extra coverage on top of your statutory insurance. 
In addition to the global benefits listed above, we have some US-specific benefits as well:
- FSA and HSAs. We don't contribute to these accounts, but we do offer them as an option. 
- 401(k). We contribute a portion of your salary to your 401(k). 
- Disability insurance. If you get disabled, we have a policy that will pay out a portion of your salary. 
Compensation Range: $175K - $225K
